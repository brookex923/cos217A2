What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.

None

In fulfillment of the requirement from section 2.4.6 of the Academic
Regulations in Princeton's Rights, Rules, Responsibilities guide,
and the COS 217 Generative AI policy, disclose and describe how you
used AI in completing this assignment:

I used AI to help me write and debug code for the stra.c and strp.c
files. I also asked it to help generate some examples of str.h
so that I could get a sense of what the general formatting is. 
Then, I used AI to help me write the comments for my str.h file,
and I edited them a bit afterwards as well. 
I also used AI to help me write the comments for my file headers.
I used AI to help me write my replaceAndWrite function (including 
comments), as well as
debugging the replace.c file. Lastly, I used AI to help me understand
the key concepts of this assignment.

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

This was helpful in understanding the relationship between 
pointers and arrays! 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

What warnings does splint generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."

None.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on stra.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

At first, I received the following warnings: 
Checking stra.c

   stra.c: line 1: high priority: 
   A file should begin with a comment.

   str.h: line 1: high priority: 
   A file should begin with a comment.

   str.h: line 16: high priority: 
   A function's comment should state explicitly what the function returns

   str.h: line 22: high priority: 
   A function's comment should state explicitly what the function returns

   str.h: line 37: high priority: 
   A function's comment should state explicitly what the function returns

I agree with these warnings as I had forgotten to include detailed comments
in my code. I believe that comments are important for readability, so 
I added them right away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is it possible for Str_copy or Str_concat to call assert to verify
that the destination memory area specified by the caller is large
enough? Explain.

No, this is not possible. In C, when a function is passed into an 
array, it automatically decays into a pointer to the first element 
of the array. This means that the function only knows the memory 
address of the first element of the array, and it does not know
the array length or how much memory is allocated for the array. 

Thus, our assert functions can only verify that the pointer actually 
points somewhere, but they cannot verify that the "somewhere" is big 
enough.
